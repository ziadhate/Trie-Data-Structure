# Trie Data Structure in C++

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Trie (Prefix Tree)** data structure in C++ to efficiently store and search words.  
The implementation supports the following functionalities:
- Insert words into the Trie
- Search for complete words
- Check if a prefix exists
- Autocomplete suggestions for a given prefix
- Handle edge cases like empty strings and case sensitivity

The project also includes a **test suite in `main()`** that demonstrates all features with sample words.
